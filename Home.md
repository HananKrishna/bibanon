* If you just need to **drop off new stories/content**, visit our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/0kPf8xuFPFa3iihT), we can help research and put it together as a wikipage.
* The Bibliotheca Anonoma uses a [Kanban Board system](http://trello.com/bibanon), to coordinate our projects. It's publicly viewable (and commentable), so monitor our [progress there.](http://trello.com/bibanon)
  * We're trying to migrate to [Libreboard](http://libreboard.com) to replace Trello. That way, we can modify it to work as an anonymous dropbox for effortless contribution or community collaboration. Stay tuned.

  * The [Storehouse](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7WYx7u6HJh_Z3FjU2F0NFNyQWs) contains files deemed critical for archival, but still under review. We tossed them into Google Drive for now.

  * Stay on the lookout for pages that may have fallen by the wayside, are in need of maintenance, or are orphaned. Place pages [here](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Maintenance).
