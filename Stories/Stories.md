It was embarrassing, but she caught on to his unrequited love... and decided to ask him out on a date, and they hit it off.
  * It's one of these amazing Hollywood/HBO-quality stories with temptations, love triangles, twists and turns, drama, tragedy, and obviously intercourse. But at the end of it all, it's better to have loved... than to never have loved at all.

  * We were unable to find the original Reddit threads of this story on our own, but a user named [Vestrideus](https://github.com/vestrideus) discovered that we had mistitled it 1984, rather than 1985. Many thanks, bro.
